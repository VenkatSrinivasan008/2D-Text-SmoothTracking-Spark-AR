Using 2D text with smooth face tracker  

Most people are really have tough time with 2D text filters that getting aproved by the facebook.To solve this problem I have created a simple patches, this patche will help you get the approval, it worked for me most of the time but it's not 100% viable option. So feel free to give a try. Don't blame me if it not working. Am just giving you a viable choice.

How to Use:

Add Face tracker in to your project and drag and drop that into your patch editor and connect its 3d face position value into the 2D Text smooth patch.
Then enter the XY Position of your 2D text that where it want to be placed on the screen thats it.
Patch will do the rest.
Make sure 2D text object and the Face Tracker must be in same Hierarchy (refer the image below) to work correctly with the patch values.

Note:

2D Text position values range must be between this X (-0.22 to 0.22) Y (-0.28 to 0.28)
